But who was Khana, when he lived in the world, that information is not recorded in irrefutable documents in history, but the sayings that have been spoken by people for ages are not completely false, so it can be emphasized that there was someone behind it.<br \/>\nWho is he?<\/p>\n<p>There are several legends about who Khanna was and when he was. Some of it is close to the truth, some is full of lies.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about myths later, let&#8217;s turn our eyes to history first. Khana is believed to have been born around 800 AD, in Chandraketugarh, near Barasat in present-day North Twenty-four Parganas district. Khan&#8217;s father&#8217;s name is Atnacharya. This also has no historical basis, the idea is derived from a verse by Khana, where Khana says: &#8216;I am Attanacharya&#8217;s daughter, Gante-gante kare na or anati.<br \/>\n&#8216;<br \/>\nExcavation of the ruins of Chandraketugarh in Barasa has not been completed yet. The historical foundation of Khana who lived here is not strong. But those who do research on history, many times they have to combine folklore and documents, find some patterns and match two by two by four. Proverb-Imperial history and folklore researcher of Bengal. Dinesh Chandra Sen wrote, Khana&#8217;s husband Mihir lived for many days in a place called Chandrapur, and this Chandrapur was a center of Chandraketurajya. After nearly a hundred years, when the remains of Chandraketu Gar were really found in Barasa, people assumed that Barah-Mihir-Khanai or why should it be left, this was the house of Khana-Mihir.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What rote is a bit.
