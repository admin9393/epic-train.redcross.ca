The four-tusked elephant, the thirty cubit long crocodile or the grinning three-horned rhinoceros of those days, none of these are found today. Sometimes, on the rocks or under the ice in caves, some traces of their skeletons are found &#8211; from which scholars know that such and such beasts once existed on earth. Those who practice all these things can tell by looking at the teeth little by little &#8211; what kind of animal&#8217;s teeth it is, whether it eats meat or is vegetarian, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The animal I am talking about is called Sabre-toothed Tiger in English. Its skeletons have been found in Europe, America, our country and many other places. It is difficult to say what he did with these sword-like teeth. It is not convenient to bite with such long teeth; Also, this tiger&#8217;s jawbone was not as strong as that of today&#8217;s tigers, so its bite force was less.<\/p>\n<p>The teeth were about six inches long, with knife-like edges\u2014perhaps useful for slicing off prey.<br \/>\nThe appearance and color of the animal changes according to the conditions in which it lives. The black spots on the tiger&#8217;s body can tell you that it has a habit of moving in the bush&#8211;when the tiger hides in the thickets of grass, the yellow-black stripes of the tiger mix with the light and shadow of the tall grass in such a way that you can tell at a glance. Not that there is anything but bushes. But as far as we can tell, it seems that our saber tooth lived in the open as much as Monsieur Sinha\u2014so it&#8217;s possible that he didn&#8217;t have the tiger-like markings he once did.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You must know that there were animals in those days that are no longer seen today.
